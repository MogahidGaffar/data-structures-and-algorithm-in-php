This program demonstrates a powerful recursive algorithm for computing factorials in PHP. Using recursion, the code elegantly solves the factorial problem, showcasing the simplicity and efficiency of recursive thinking in algorithmic solutions.

## Key Features:
- Recursive Approach: This program utilizes a recursive function to calculate factorials, tapping into the power of a function calling itself to solve smaller subproblems until reaching the base case.
- Clarity and Readability: The code is crafted with clear, concise recursive logic, making it easy to understand and appreciate the beauty of recursive solutions.
- Efficiency and Elegance: Despite its simplicity, the recursive factorial algorithm efficiently computes factorials, demonstrating the elegance of recursion in solving mathematical problems.
## How It Works:
The recursive factorial algorithm functions by breaking down the factorial problem into smaller instances until it reaches a base case. For example, to find the factorial of 'n':
- If 'n' is 0 or 1 (the base case), the factorial is 1.
- For any other positive integer 'n', the factorial of 'n' is computed by multiplying 'n' with the factorial of (n-1), invoking the function recursively until reaching the base case.


## Usage:
Feel free to explore and execute the provided PHP code to witness the recursive factorial algorithm in action. You can test it with different values of 'n' to observe how the algorithm swiftly computes factorials using recursion.

This implementation serves as an educational resource, illustrating the elegance and efficiency of recursive thinking in solving mathematical problems like factorials using PHP.
